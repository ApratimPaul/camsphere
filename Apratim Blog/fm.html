                Creating a concise direction, vision, and goal for the project. A goal without a plan is just a wish.
                Choose an idea that is realistically executable and you enjoy the shoot. Define the story and shots that
                will make up the project, to do that first create a script, characters and a storyboard. After gathering
                all the elements of the production and planning the practical parts of the production, create a budget,
                scout location and gather your equipment. Now wrap up final elements before production.

                Understanding your Camera
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                Understanding your camera is really the key that makes a good video into a great one. The latitude of
                your camera most of you might not have heard the term and no one’s really talking about this nowadays.
                It’s the ability of your camera to evenly expose a frame, in filming cameras the latitude ranges up to
                14 f-stops. Consider having a well-lit subject and overexposed or underexposed background naturally your
                attention will be drawn towards the subject. Consider a landscape and your frame is unevenly exposed;
                that's a major turn off for viewers. Next pay attention to your White Balance this can change the vibe
                or mood of the whole scene. Talking about settings, always shoot at the highest available resolution and
                at a frame rate of 60 Fps.

            <div class="content">
                Mastering your lenses is an incredibly important tool to become a professional video creator because the
                choice of lenses totally changes the feel and overall aesthetic of the film. Now coming to focus mode,
                always use manual focus because you specifically need to tell your camera where it needs to focus with
                respect to the focal plane because most of the time it will take its focus point in the centre or well
                exposed parts of the scene. That is not what you always want while shooting a video. If you own multiple
                lenses then I would suggest you use a prime lens for drawing attention towards the subject on a single
                plane, wide angle lens for shooting landscapes and wider range of subjects and zoom lens for close up,
                macro and wider range of shooting. If shooting in low light use a prime lens preferably as they have
                lower f stop. If you intend to travel then I suggest you carry small and necessary gears only.

                Lighting and Sound
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                Key principles in lighting in your film and video is to control and keep in mind how you’re affecting
                the viewer. The light shows your viewer the ambience of the scene and the sound track decides what to
                feel. People don’t really consciously know the importance of lighting every element of the scene but it
                really affects how you feel. Imagine seeing a beautiful sunset you’re there with your girlfriend, maybe
                you don’t have a girlfriend doesn’t matter. The point is the light in the scene sets your mood and how
                to feel. If you are shooting outside without specific requirements then shoot in the golden hour of the
                day. Now that you have managed to draw the attention of your viewers and set the ambience it’s time to
                make them feel the scene. If the audio in your film is incomplete the story that you are trying to tell
                would remain unfinished. I already have discussed earlier in the Equipment section related to Light and
                sound.

                Framing Understanding
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                Let’s see the different types of framing all these different choices that you’re going to use to create
                an incredible video. First comes the extreme side shot or landscape shot, this is an excellent type of
                framing that you use to establish a character in a specific environment. This captures a large range of
                information, this shot can’t be achieved by a telephoto or a macro lens. You need something around
                16-35MM. Then comes medium shots that are generally the waist up, It's closer up on the subject and you
                can still see hand gestures. When you close in a bit farther we get medium close up. For these shots you
                can use something varying from 35-70MM. There are many more shots like over the shoulder, vertigo,
                reflection on the surface etc. You should get more creative with framing shots that will lead you to
                gain more experience.

                Mastering Camera Movements
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                The language of camera movement definitely my most favourite part of filmmaking besides the editing
                process is using dynamic camera movement, right moving the camera physically through space forward and
                back left and right up and down and this three dimensional axis that we have to create. If you are doing
                a hand-held shot with camera movement then I would suggest you turn on the VR (Virtual Stabilization). A
                dolly shot with camera movement or a steady cam or a gimbal. I personally own a Webill-S which works
                with complete charm. I can’t exactly tell you what camera movements to use, because that depends on
                different shots.

                This part can make a very normal looking video into a masterpiece, key to editing a video is
                understanding every shot choice and deciding its sequence, shot length and knowing when to cut. Yes, if
                there are mistakes while shooting those can be corrected while editing them. At last comes the colour
                grading, this will turn your video into Hollywood level movie if done with perfection. I will share my
                edited videos and how I edit them accordingly. Post it as you like and make sure to look out for
                copyrighted contents in your video and you are good to go. I am open to any critic and help you lookout
                for, feel free to ping me and ask if you have any doubts regarding these.
