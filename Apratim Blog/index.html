                All you need to start with your journey is a pair of observant eyes and a camera, be it mobile or
                DSLR
                doesn't really matter. Later on I'll show images clicked on mobile are far better than many clicks
                on a
                DSLR. <br><br>

                The point is lack of equipment should not stop you from being creative. <br><br>

                There are some basic technical terms we need to get familiar with if shooting in manual mode.
                <br><br>

                What is manual mode and why use it when the AI provides such a wonderful auto mode?<br><br>

                Do you still use a calculator to add up, no because you know how to do it mentally. It’s the same
                thing
                with camera if we are not shooting in manual we won't have an idea of what's going inside and what
                are
                the so-called complicated ISO, Exposure, and Aperture.

            There are various modes on a camera but only few of them comes handy. We will find many
            places where people talk about each and every one of them but according to me for a beginner it’s hard
            to
            absorb all that so I'll be talking about only the one's that comes handy while shooting.

                <div class="mode">Shutter Priority</div>
                <div class="details">
                    It’s used when we are shooting extreme long shots or extreme fast. In case of extreme fast shots
                    like shooting from a moving car or shooting a moving object like a car, insect, player etc. When
                    shooting slowly that is known as long-exposure photography, where the shutter of the camera
                    stays
                    open for a longer period of time to capture a specific movement like Night traffic and moving
                    water.
                    There’s another section where I will explain in detail on the topic of long-exposure
                    photography. It
                    gives you complete control over its shutter speed and sets everything else on its own to expose
                    the
                    image properly.

                <div class="details">
                    This mode is very versatile and can be used in many different conditions. This mode gives you
                    control over the width of its aperture. This is where it starts to get complicated so I won’t
                    share
                    any technical terms with you whereas I’ll just share my practical knowledge. This mode comes
                    handy
                    to me while I am in a hurry but I need to click an image, I personally keep my f-stop around f/7
                    -
                    f/8 this range will give you the sharpest image without having set everything according to your
                    scene.

                    This is semi auto mode on camera where the image is properly exposed by the camera itself but
                    all
                    other parameters can be altered by the user whether in Full-auto we don’t have control over
                    anything. Personally I won’t suggest you use this mode unless you aren’t able to figure out the
                    values of a particular scene.

                    This is where you actually start playing with the camera, not really but with the parameters of
                    the
                    camera. The exposure triangle comes in handy which we discussed above and will be explained
                    furthermore. If you are just starting in this field I would suggest you to go through the
                    Shutter
                    and Aperture Priority mode rather than starting directly with manual mode that would frustrate
                    you.
                    Later on I will share images captured by me with the parameters of those mentioned.

                The Exposure Triangle

            <div class="content">
                The exposure triangle is just a simple way of explaining the three horsemen of the camera. ISO,
                Aperture
                and Shutter Speed, these three come together to expose the image properly. Little error in these can
                underexpose or overexpose the image. Exposing a photo means how bright the photo appears to our
                eyes.
                <br><br>
                The exposure triangle is a common way to explain the relationship between the three variables in
                nailing
                exposure. You must find a balance between ISO, Aperture, and Shutter speed to achieve the exposure
                you
                desire. I will attach a chart

        <div class="heading">Long-Exposure Photography
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            This is a very unique and creative way to take photos, the shutter of your camera remains open for a
            longer
            amount of time compared to normal. This basically blurs out the moving objects or subjects in the image
            creates a dreamy and silky effect in your image. This usually comes handy capturing clouds, moving
            water,
            night traffic or star trails. All you need is a tripod and you are good to go. I will attach some images
            with its parameters how I take long exposure. If you are willing to do Long-Exposure in bright daytime
            for a
            very long period of time you have to buy a ND Filter that is a Neutral Density Filter that manually
            helps
            you expose the photo according to need. There’s a small life hack you can apply if you don’t own a ND
            Filter
            still you need to take a long exposure but the image is getting overexposed. Place your device on a
            tripod
            then shoot a video for 30secs approximately. Import the video to your machine and trim it to 4-5 seconds
            and
            maximum 10 second if your device is powerful. Open Photoshop import the video file as layers and then
            select
            all the layers then from layer options select smart objects and stack mode to mean. You will get a good
            looking long exposure photography without having to spend much on ND Filters.

                Most of the cases you will see people explaining it’s the sensitivity of the camera but if you ask
                me I
                will put it in this way, it’s a software based feature that can expose an image as we like. That’s
                why
                increasing it to a level more than 1600 or so introduces grains to the picture in entry level
                cameras.
                So I’ll recommend you to keep it below 1600 and try playing with the shutter speed and aperture to
                expose the photo properly. Base ISO is the lowest ISO setting on a particular camera that does not
                digitally increase exposure most of the times it's 100.

                Exposing with Your Camera’s Light Meter

            </div>
            <div class="content">
                A light meter is a device used to measure the amount of light. A light meter is used to determine
                the
                proper exposure for a photograph. We can find it in the viewfinder of your camera or in the display
                LCD
                or in the display near the shutter release button. The scale ranges from positive (+3) to negative
                (-3).
                If you are starting off I would suggest taking a quick look at the scale and adjusting settings so
                the
                meter’s reading is “0” in the center.

                Reading a Histogram
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                The histogram is a graph that shows you the exposure of every part of your frame. It comes handy
                when
                editing the image. To achieve a properly exposed image try having a good medium fat graph in the
                middle
                between your shadows and your highlights. It’s a graphical representation of the exposure values of
                your
                image. It can also include colour and tonal values.

                Can be defined as positioning the objects in the frame. It is what guides our eyes through a
                photograph
                and gives importance to the subject in relation to the rest of the photo. Can dramatically change
                how a
                viewer sees your photo. Influenced by angle, perspective, size, position. <br><br>

                <h3>The Rule of Third</h3>
                The rule of thirds is a compositional rule that involves mentally dividing up your image using 2
                horizontal lines and 2 vertical lines. You then position the important elements in your scene along
                those lines, or at the points where they meet. A rule of thirds grid.

                Depth of Field

            <div class="content">
                It is the distance between the distance between the nearest and the farthest objects that are in
                acceptably sharp focus in an image. Here shallow depth of field means the more blurry background, to
                achieve that look we have three different ways like the larger aperture, the closer subject to the
                camera and more telephoto lens. If in low-light the camera struggles to find focus point at times I
                suggest using the manual focus mode and the focus ring present on most of the lenses to get a crisp
                image.

                <ul>
                    <li>Don’t take out your SD Card from camera oftenly it damages the sensor head in camera</li>
                    <li>When changing lenses, tilt the camera down at an angle, so that dust particles don't settle
                        on
                        the mirror/sensor of your camera.
                    </li>
                    <li>Clean your lenses regularly with Isopropyl Alcohol Solution and Microfiber Cloth.
                    </li>
                    <li>Always keep a spare battery with you even though your primary one is fully charged.</li>
                    <li>Don’t forget to remove your battery from the camera after you are done with shooting.</li>
                    <li>Always use lens hood or UV Filter as protection for your lenses.</li>
                    <li>Don’t remove the camera straps until you are using it on gimbal.</li>
                    <li>Avoid storing your gears in moist or damp places.</li>
                    <li>Don’t touch your camera with oil or dirt on your hands, which eventually leads to wearing
                        out of
                        the leather coating from the body.</li>
                    <li>While purchasing gears for camera lookout for fake and duplicate products.</li>
